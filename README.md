# Gold Rush Smart Contract

Gold Rush is a token-based betting smart contract that allows users to bet on the price movement of gold or specific stocks within a specific time period (called a round).

Users place bets using Gold Rush Tokens (GRT), and winners receive rewards based on the outcome of the round.

## Overview
- Each round has a start time (start_time) and a end time (end_time), during which users can place or withdraw bets before the cutoff.
- After the round ends, the Keeper triggers a settlement process to determine the winner based on the price from the Oracle.
- Rewards are not automatically distributed but are stored as a claimable amount that winners can claim manually.

## Features

### Betting System

- Users can place bets on the price movement of gold or specific stocks (e.g., up/down).
- Bets are placed using GRT tokens.
- Bets can be withdrawn as long as they have not exceeded the cutoff.

### Round Lifecycle

- Admins create new rounds with a start_time and end_time.
- After the start_time, the round automatically becomes Active and accepts bets.
- After the end_time, bets are locked and the round enters the Settlement process and the outcome is determined.

### Keeper Automation

- The Keeper is responsible for triggering:
    - Round activation when the start_time is reached.
    - Round settlement when the end_time is reacged.
- The Keeper retrieves prices from the Oracle, calculates winners, and marks claimable prizes.
- If the price is not retrieved, the round is assigned a PendingSettlement status so it can be retried.

### Price Oracle

- Retrieves real-time prices from an external source (Chainlink or other whitelisted sources).
- Price data is only used during settlement process.

### Rewards & Claims

- Rewards are calculated from the total pool of losing bets and distributed proportionally to winners.
- Rewards are not sent automatically but are stored in the bet as claimable_amount.
- Users can claim rewards after settlement, if claimable_amount > 0.

### Admin Operations

- Create a new round (with a future schedule).
- Manage system configurations (fees, oracle, etc.).
- Pause/unpause the program in an emergency.
- Cancel a round (before settlement) to return all bets.

### Emergency & Safety

- Admins can perform an emergency pause to temporarily stop all betting operations (except claims).
- If settlement fails, the round will be marked as Pending Settlement so that no additional bets are accepted and can be reprocessed.
