# Gold Rush Smart Contract

Gold Rush is a token-based betting smart contract that allows users to bet on the price movement of gold or specific stocks within a specific time period (called a round).

Users place bets using Gold Rush Tokens (GRT), and winners receive rewards based on the outcome of the round.

## Overview
- Each round has a start time (start_time) and a end time (end_time), during which users can place or withdraw bets before the cutoff.
- After the round ends, the Keeper triggers a settlement process to determine the winner based on the price from the Oracle.
- Rewards are not automatically distributed but are stored as a claimable amount that winners can claim manually.

## Features

### Betting System

- Users can place bets on the price movement of gold or specific stocks (e.g., up/down).
- Bets are placed using GRT tokens.
- Bets can be withdrawn as long as they have not exceeded the cutoff.

### Round Lifecycle

- Admins create new rounds with a start_time and end_time.
- After the start_time, the round automatically becomes Active and accepts bets.
- After the end_time, bets are locked and the round enters the Settlement process and the outcome is determined.

### Keeper Automation

- The Keeper is responsible for triggering:
    - Round activation when the start_time is reached.
    - Round settlement when the end_time is reacged.
- The Keeper retrieves prices from the Oracle, calculates winners, and marks claimable prizes.
- If the price is not retrieved, the round is assigned a PendingSettlement status so it can be retried.

### Price Oracle

- Retrieves real-time prices from an external source (Chainlink or other whitelisted sources).
- Price data is only used during settlement process.

### Rewards & Claims

- Rewards are calculated from the total pool of losing bets and distributed proportionally to winners.
- Rewards are not sent automatically but are stored in the bet as claimable_amount.
- Users can claim rewards after settlement, if claimable_amount > 0.

### Admin Operations

- Create a new round (with a future schedule).
- Manage system configurations (fees, oracle, etc.).
- Pause/unpause the program in an emergency.
- Cancel a round (before settlement) to return all bets.

### Emergency & Safety

- Admins can perform an emergency pause to temporarily stop all betting operations (except claims).
- If settlement fails, the round will be marked as Pending Settlement so that no additional bets are accepted and can be reprocessed.

## Fee Mechanism

The Gold Rush smart contract charges a fee on each bet to sustain the platform. The fee is collected in the same token used for betting (GRT) and is transferred to the treasury after the round is settled.

### Fee Structure

- **Gold Price Bets**: `fee_gold_price_bps` (in basis points, e.g., 50 bps = 0.5%)
- **Stock Price Bets**: `fee_stock_price_bps` (in basis points, e.g., 50 bps = 0.5%)
- **Treasury Account**: `treasury` (the account that receives collected fees)

> Note: Fee is calculated on the bet amount and deducted only at settlement, not at the time of placing a bet. This allows for refunds in case the round is cancelled.

### Fee Calculation

For each round, the total fee collected is calculated as:

$$
\text{fee} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{amount}_i \times \frac{\text{fee\_bps}}{10000}
$$

Where:

- $n$ = total number of bets in the round  
- $\text{amount}_i$ = bet amount of the $i$-th bet  
- $\text{fee\_bps}$ = fee basis points depending on bet type (gold or stock)

The remaining balance after fee deduction becomes the **reward pool**:

$$
\text{total\_reward\_pool} = \text{total\_pool} - \text{total\_fee\_collected}
$$

- `total_pool` = sum of all bet amounts in the round  
- `total_fee_collected` = sum of all fees deducted  
- `total_reward_pool` = amount available for distribution to winning bets

### Settlement Flow for Fees

1. **Round ends**: Keeper triggers the settlement process after `end_time`.  
2. **Calculate fees**: Fee is calculated for each bet based on `fee_gold_price_bps` or `fee_stock_price_bps`.  
3. **Transfer to treasury**: `total_fee_collected` is transferred to the treasury account.  
4. **Compute reward pool**: Remaining GRT is assigned to `total_reward_pool` for winners.  

> This approach ensures fairness and transparency: users only pay fees if the round is successfully settled, and the treasury receives an accurate portion without affecting refund logic.

### Example

Suppose a round has the following bets:

| User | Bet Amount | Bet Type   | Fee (bps) |
|------|------------|------------|------------|
| A    | 10 GRT     | Gold       | 50         |
| B    | 20 GRT     | Stock      | 100        |

Calculations:

- Fee for A: \( 10 \times 0.005 = 0.05 \) GRT  
- Fee for B: \( 20 \times 0.01 = 0.2 \) GRT  

Total fee collected: \( 0.05 + 0.2 = 0.25 \) GRT  

Total reward pool: \( 10 + 20 - 0.25 = 29.75 \) GRT

---

## Reward Calculation

The Gold Rush betting system uses a **weight-based model** combined with a **self-claim mechanism** to efficiently distribute rewards after each round ends.

### Concept

Each bet has a **weight** that represents its contribution to the reward pool.
Weight depends on:

1. **Bet Amount** â€” Larger bets contribute more.
2. **Bet Type Factor** â€” Bets on `PercentageChange` may carry a higher factor than simple `Up/Down` bets.
3. **Time Factor** â€” Bets placed earlier in the round may carry a higher weight than bets placed near the end of the round.

**General formula for a bet's weight:**

$$
\text{weight} = \text{amount} \times \text{side\_factor} \times \text{time\_factor}
$$

Where:

- `amount` = number of GRT tokens bet (before fees)
- `side_factor` = multiplier based on `BetSide`
  - Up/Down: `1.0`
  - PercentageChange: `>1.0` depending on the magnitude of percentage
- `time_factor` = multiplier based on how early the bet was placed (range: $0 < \text{time\_factor} \le 1.0$)

### Settlement Process

When the round ends, the **keeper** settles it:

1. The **Keeper** determines the winning bets by comparing `locked_price` and `final_price`.
2. Mark all winning bets as `Won` and sum their weights:

$$
\text{round.winners\_weight} = \sum_{\text{all winning bets}} \text{bet.weight}
$$

3. Mark all losing bets as `Lost`.
4. Calculate and transfer fees:

$$
\text{total\_fee\_collected} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{amount}_i \times \frac{\text{fee\_bps}}{10000}
$$

5. Move `total_fee_collected` from round vault to `treasury`.
6. Update `round.total_reward_pool`:
$$
\text{round.total\_reward\_pool} = \text{round.total\_pool} - \text{round.total\_fee\_collected}
$$

> **Note:** At this stage, **no rewards are sent to users yet** â€” only marking bet results and collecting fees.

### Self-Claim by User

When a user claims their reward:

1. Read `Bet.weight` and `round.winners_weight`.
2. Calculate the claimable reward:

$$
\text{reward} = \frac{\text{bet.weight}}{\text{round.winners\_weight}} \times \text{round.total\_reward\_pool}
$$

3. Transfer the reward from the round vault to the user's account.
4. Mark `Bet.claimed = true`.

---

### Important Notes

- `round.total_reward_pool` is equal to `round.total_pool - round.total_fee_collected`.
- The reward includes the user's original stake. Losing users lose their stake, and their funds contribute to the reward pool for winners.
- If **all users win**, no one loses their stake. All winners simply receive their original stake back minus proportional fees.

---

### Example Calculation

| User | Amount (GRT) | Bet Type | Fee (bps)   | Time Factor | Weight |
|------|--------------|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| A    | 10           | Gold     | 50          |    1.0      | 10     |
| B    | 20           | Stock    | 100         |    1.0      | 20     |

- Total pool: $10 + 20 = 30$
- Fees:
  - A â†’ $10 \times 0.005 = 0.05$ GRT
  - B â†’ $20 \times 0.01 = 0.2$ GRT
- Total fee collected = $0.05 + 0.2 = 0.25$ GRT
- Total reward pool = $30 - 0.25 = 29.75$ GRT
- Suppose both A and B win:
  - `round.winners_weight = 10 + 20 = 30`

Then:

$$
\text{Reward A} = \frac{10}{30} \times 29.75 \approx 9.92\text{ GRT}
$$
$$
\text{Reward B} = \frac{20}{30} \times 29.75 \approx 19.83\text{ GRT}
$$

Total = 29.75 GRT distributed, and 0.25 GRT sent to the treasury.

- `keeper_authorities` must not be empty
- `min_bet_amount` must be greater than `0`

#### Logic
1. Derive PDA for `config` using seeds `["config"]`
2. Create the `config` account
3. Initialize fields:
   - `admin = admin.unwrap_or(initializer.key())`
   - `settlement_authority = settlement_authority`
   - `keeper_authorities = keeper_authorities`
   - `token_mint = token_mint`
   - `treasury = treasury`
   - `fee_gold_price_bps = fee_gold_price_bps`
   - `fee_stock_price_bps = fee_stock_price_bps`
   - `min_bet_amount = min_bet_amount`
4. Set default fields:
   - `status = Active`
   - `current_round_counter = 0`
   - `version = 1`
   - `bump = bump`

#### Emits / Side Effects
- Creates a new `Config` account at PDA `["config"]`
- Stores global configuration and admin data

#### Purpose
This instruction is used by the Admin to create and schedule a new round.
The created round will automatically become active when the start time is reached, and will automatically close (lock) when the end time is reached.
Users can only place bets while the round is in Active status.

#### Context
| Account             | Type                       | Description                                      |

| `start_time` | `i64` (unix timestamp) | Round start time |
| `end_time` | `i64` (unix timestamp) | Round end time |

---

#### Validations
- `start_time < end_time`
- `start_time > current_timestamp` (cannot create rounds in the past)
- Caller = `config.admin`

---

#### Logic
1. Derive PDA for `round` using seeds `["round", round_id]` where `round_id = config.current_round_counter + 1` 
2. Create round `vault` account to hold bets
3. Initialize `round` fields:
   - `round_id = config.current_round_counter + 1`
   - `asset = asset`
   - `start_time = start_time`
   - `end_time = end_time`
   - `status = Planned`
   - `locked_price = 0`
   - `final_price = None`
   - `total_pool = 0`

---

#### Validations
- `keeper` must be in `config.keeper_authorities`
- `round.status == Planned`
- `Clock::now() >= round.start_time`
- `config.status == Active`
- `asset_price > 0`

---

#### Logic
1. Change `round.status` to `Active`
2. Set `round.settled_at = Clock::now()`
3. Set `round.locked_price = asset_price`

---

#### Emits / Side Effects
- Change `Round` status from `Planned` â†’ `Active`
- Indicate that users can now start placing bets (`place_bet()`) on this round

---

## Errors
| Code                  | Meaning                                             |

### Keeper: Settle Round

#### Purpose
This instruction is executed by the Keeper to perform settlement on a round that has reached its end_time.
The settlement process retrieves the final price from the oracle, determines the winner and loser, calculates the winners_weight, and marks all bets as either Won or Lost.
After successful settlement, the round status changes to Ended.

#### Context
| Field         | Type                    | Description                                         |

- `round.status` must be `Active` or `PendingSettlement`
- `Clock::now() >= round.end_time`
- `config.status == Active`
- `bet_list` cannot be empty

---

## Logic
1. if `final_price` is not provided (0) set `round.status = PendingSettlement` and return (keeper will retry later).
2. Otherwise, proceed with settlement:
    - Set `round.final_price = final_price`
    - Calculate the result of each `bet`:
      - If the prediction is correct â†’ `bet.status = Won`
      - If the prediction is incorrect â†’ `bet.status = Lost`
    - Calculate and set `winners_weight` based on the total number of tokens won
    - Calculate total fees and set to `round.total_fee_collected`
    - Transfer `round.total_fee_collected` from `round.vault` to `config.treasury`
    - Set `round.total_reward_pool = round.total_pool - round.total_fee_collected`
    - Change `round.status = Ended`
    - Set `round.settled_at = Clock::now()`.

---

## Emits / Side Effects
- Change all `bets` from `Pending` to `Won` or `Lost`
- Change `round.status` to `Ended`
- Save `final_price` and `winners_weight` in `round`

---
