# Gold Rush Smart Contract

Gold Rush is a token-based betting smart contract that allows users to bet on the price movement of gold or specific stocks within a specific time period (called a round).

Users place bets using Gold Rush Tokens (GRT), and winners receive rewards based on the outcome of the round.

## Overview
- Each round has a start time (start_time) and a end time (end_time), during which users can place or withdraw bets before the cutoff.
- After the round ends, the Keeper triggers a settlement process to determine the winner based on the price from the Oracle.
- Rewards are not automatically distributed but are stored as a claimable amount that winners can claim manually.

## Features

### Betting System

- Users can place bets on the price movement of gold or specific stocks (e.g., up/down).
- Bets are placed using GRT tokens.
- Bets can be withdrawn as long as they have not exceeded the cutoff.

### Round Lifecycle

- Admins create new rounds with a start_time and end_time.
- After the start_time, the round automatically becomes Active and accepts bets.
- After the end_time, bets are locked and the round enters the Settlement process and the outcome is determined.

### Keeper Automation

- The Keeper is responsible for triggering:
    - Round activation when the start_time is reached.
    - Round settlement when the end_time is reacged.
- The Keeper retrieves prices from the Oracle, calculates winners, and marks claimable prizes.
- If the price is not retrieved, the round is assigned a PendingSettlement status so it can be retried.

### Price Oracle

- Retrieves real-time prices from an external source (Chainlink or other whitelisted sources).
- Price data is only used during settlement process.

### Rewards & Claims

- Rewards are calculated from the total pool of losing bets and distributed proportionally to winners.
- Rewards are not sent automatically but are stored in the bet as claimable_amount.
- Users can claim rewards after settlement, if claimable_amount > 0.

### Admin Operations

- Create a new round (with a future schedule).
- Manage system configurations (fees, oracle, etc.).
- Pause/unpause the program in an emergency.
- Cancel a round (before settlement) to return all bets.

### Emergency & Safety

- Admins can perform an emergency pause to temporarily stop all betting operations (except claims).
- If settlement fails, the round will be marked as Pending Settlement so that no additional bets are accepted and can be reprocessed.

## Fee Mechanism

The Gold Rush smart contract charges a fee on each bet to sustain the platform. The fee is collected in the same token used for betting (GRT) and is transferred to the treasury after the round is settled.

### Fee Structure

- **Gold Price Bets**: `fee_gold_price_bps` (in basis points, e.g., 50 bps = 0.5%)
- **Stock Price Bets**: `fee_stock_price_bps` (in basis points, e.g., 50 bps = 0.5%)
- **Treasury Account**: `treasury` (the account that receives collected fees)

> Note: Fee is calculated on the bet amount and deducted only at settlement, not at the time of placing a bet. This allows for refunds in case the round is cancelled.

### Fee Calculation

For each round, the total fee collected is calculated as:

$$
\text{fee} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{amount}_i \times \frac{\text{fee bps}}{10000}
$$

Where:

- $n$ = total number of bets in the round  
- $\text{amount}_i$ = bet amount of the $i$-th bet  
- $\text{fee bps}$ = fee basis points depending on bet type (gold or stock)

The remaining balance after fee deduction becomes the **reward pool**:

$$
\text{total reward pool} = \text{total pool} - \text{total fee collected}
$$

- `total_pool` = sum of all bet amounts in the round  
- `total_fee_collected` = sum of all fees deducted  
- `total_reward_pool` = amount available for distribution to winning bets

### Settlement Flow for Fees

1. **Round ends**: Keeper triggers the settlement process after `end_time`.  
2. **Calculate fees**: Fee is calculated for each bet based on `fee_gold_price_bps` or `fee_stock_price_bps`.  
3. **Transfer to treasury**: `total_fee_collected` is transferred to the treasury account.  
4. **Compute reward pool**: Remaining GRT is assigned to `total_reward_pool` for winners.  

> This approach ensures fairness and transparency: users only pay fees if the round is successfully settled, and the treasury receives an accurate portion without affecting refund logic.

### Example

Suppose a round has the following bets:

| User | Bet Amount | Bet Type   | Fee (bps) |
|------|------------|------------|------------|
| A    | 10 GRT     | Gold       | 50         |
| B    | 20 GRT     | Stock      | 100        |

Calculations:

- Fee for A: \( 10 \times 0.005 = 0.05 \) GRT  
- Fee for B: \( 20 \times 0.01 = 0.2 \) GRT  

Total fee collected: \( 0.05 + 0.2 = 0.25 \) GRT  

Total reward pool: \( 10 + 20 - 0.25 = 29.75 \) GRT

---

## Reward Calculation

The Gold Rush betting system uses a **weight-based model** combined with a **self-claim mechanism** to efficiently distribute rewards after each round ends.

### Concept

Each bet has a **weight** that represents its contribution to the reward pool.
Weight depends on:

1. **Bet Amount** â€” Larger bets contribute more.
2. **Bet Type Factor** â€” Depends on the type of asset:
   - **Gold** â†’ uses a **non-linear scaling** (small changes in gold price may still give significant weight adjustments).
   - **Stock** â†’ uses a **linear scaling** (reward grows proportionally with the price change).
3. **Time Factor** â€” Bets placed earlier in the round may carry a higher weight than bets placed near the end of the round.


**General formula for a bet's weight:**

$$
\text{weight} = \text{amount} \times \text{direction factor} \times \text{time factor}
$$

Where:

- `amount` = number of GRT tokens bet (before fees)  
- `direction_factor` = multiplier based on `BetDirection` and `BetType`:
  - Stock (linear): proportional to change, e.g., Up/Down = `1.0`, PercentageChangeBps = value depending on % change  
  - Gold (non-linear): scaling factor that can amplify small % changes into larger weight multipliers  
- `time_factor` = multiplier based on how early the bet was placed (range: $0 < \text{time factor} \le 1.0$)

### Linear vs Non-Linear Factors

The system supports both **linear** and **non-linear** factor models depending on the game type.

#### 1. Direction Factor

- **Stock (Linear)**
  The factor grows **proportionally** with the chosen percentage change.
  Example:  
  - Up/Down = `1.0`
  - +5% change = `1.05`
  - +10% change = `1.10`

- **Gold (Non-Linear)**
  The factor grows **faster than linear**, emphasizing higher percentage changes.  
  Example (quadratic growth):
  - Up/Down = `1.0`
  - +5% change = `1.25` (instead of 1.05)
  - +10% change = `2.0` (instead of 1.10)

This ensures that even small gold changes may yield competitive rewards due to exponential scaling.

#### 2. Time Factor

- **Stock (Linear)**  
  Earlier bets get proportionally more weight.  
  Example (normalized by round duration):  

  $$
  \text{time factor} = 1 - \frac{\text{time elapsed}}{\text{round duration}}
  $$  

  If placed at the very start â†’ `1.0`  
  If placed halfway â†’ `0.5`  
  If placed at the end â†’ close to `0.0`  

- **Gold (Non-Linear)**  
  Earlier bets are rewarded **more aggressively**.  
  Example (quadratic decay):  

  $$
  \text{time factor} = \left(1 - \frac{\text{time elapsed}}{\text{round duration}}\right)^2
  $$

  If placed at the very start â†’ `1.0`
  If placed halfway â†’ `0.25`
  If placed at the end â†’ close to `0.0`

### Settlement Process

When the round ends, the **keeper** settles it:

1. The **Keeper** determines the winning bets by comparing `locked_price` and `final_price`.
2. Mark all winning bets as `Won` and sum their weights:

$$
\text{round winners weight} = \sum_{\text{all winning bets}} \text{bet weight}
$$

3. Mark all losing bets as `Lost`.
4. Calculate and transfer fees:

$$
\text{total fee collected} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{amount}_i \times \frac{\text{fee bps}}{10000}
$$

5. Move `total_fee_collected` from round vault to `treasury`.
6. Update `round.total_reward_pool`:

$$
\text{round total reward pool} = \text{round total pool} - \text{round total fee collected}
$$

> **Note:** At this stage, **no rewards are sent to users yet** â€” only marking bet results and collecting fees.

### Self-Claim by User

When a user claims their reward:

1. Read `Bet.weight` and `round.winners_weight`.
2. Calculate the claimable reward:

$$
\text{reward} = \frac{\text{bet weight}}{\text{round winners weight}} \times \text{round total reward pool}
$$

3. Transfer the reward from the round vault to the user's account.
4. Mark `Bet.claimed = true`.

---

### Important Notes

- `round.total_reward_pool` is equal to `round.total_pool - round.total_fee_collected`.
- The reward includes the user's original stake. Losing users lose their stake, and their funds contribute to the reward pool for winners.
- If **all users win**, no one loses their stake. All winners simply receive their original stake back minus proportional fees.

---

### Example Calculation

#### Case 1: **Gold Round** (Non-Linear)

| User | Amount (GRT) | Direction | Fee (bps) | Time Factor | Direction Factor | Weight |
|------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| A    | 10           | +5%       | 50        | 1.0         | 1.25             | 12.5   |
| B    | 20           | +10%      | 50        | 0.5Â² = 0.25 | 2.0              | 10.0   |

- Total pool = $10 + 20 = 30$  
- Fees:  
  - A â†’ $10 \times 0.005 = 0.05$ GRT  
  - B â†’ $20 \times 0.005 = 0.10$ GRT  
- Total fee collected = 0.15 GRT  
- Reward pool = 29.85 GRT  
- Winners weight = 12.5 + 10.0 = 22.5  

Rewards:  
- A = $(12.5 / 22.5) \times 29.85 \approx 16.58$ GRT  
- B = $(10 / 22.5) \times 29.85 \approx 13.27$ GRT  

#### Case 2: **Stock Round** (Linear)

| User | Amount (GRT) | Direction | Fee (bps) | Time Factor | Direction Factor | Weight |
|------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| A    | 10           | +5%       | 100       | 1.0         | 1.05             | 10.5   |
| B    | 20           | +10%      | 100       | 0.5         | 1.10             | 11.0   |

- Total pool = $10 + 20 = 30$  
- Fees:  
  - A â†’ $10 \times 0.01 = 0.10$ GRT  
  - B â†’ $20 \times 0.01 = 0.20$ GRT  
- Total fee collected = 0.30 GRT  
- Reward pool = 29.70 GRT  
- Winners weight = 10.5 + 11.0 = 21.5  

Rewards:  
- A = $(10.5 / 21.5) \times 29.70 \approx 14.49$ GRT  
- B = $(11 / 21.5) \times 29.70 \approx 15.21$ GRT

| `round_vault` | `AccountInfo` (PDA) | The vault account holding bets for this round. |
| `bettor_token_account` | `Account<TokenAccount>` | The token account of the bettor to transfer GRT from. |

#### Arguments
_None_

#### Validations
- `Clock::now() < round.end_time`
- `config.status == Active`
- `round.status == Active`
- `bet.user == bettor.key()`
- `bet.status == Pending`
- `round_vault` matches `round.vault`

#### Logic
1. Transfer `bet.amount` of GRT from `round_vault` back to `bettor_token_account`
2. Close `bet` account and send rent to `bettor`
3. Update `round` fields:
    - Decrement `round.total_pool` by `amount`
    - Decrement `round.total_bets` by `1`

#### Emits / Side Effects
- Bet is canceled and removed from the round pool
- Funds are refunded back to the user

#### Errors
| Code                        | Meaning                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Unauthorized` | If `bet.user != bettor.key()` |
| `RoundNotActive` | If `round.status` is not `Active` |
| `RoundEnded` | If `Clock::now() >= round.end_time` |
| `ProgramPaused` | If `config.status != Active` |
| `InvalidBetStatus` | If `bet.status` is not `Pending` |

### User: Claim Reward
#### Purpose
This instruction allows the User to claim their reward (`claim_reward`) if their bet has won after the round is settled. The reward amount is based on the ratio of the user's bet weight to the total winners' weight in the round.

#### Context
| Field         | Type                    | Description                                         |
|-------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `bettor` | `Signer` | The address of the player placing the bet. |
| `config` | `Account<Config>` (PDA) | PDA account to store global configuration data. |
| `round` | `Account<Round>` (PDA) | The round to be settled. |
| `bet` | `Account<Bet>` (PDA) | The bet account previously initialized for this round. |
| `round_vault` | `AccountInfo` (PDA) | The vault account holding bets for this round. |
| `bettor_token_account` | `Account<TokenAccount>` | The token account of the bettor to transfer GRT from. |
| `mint` | `Account<Mint>` | Mint token used for betting. |
| `token_program` | `Program<Token>` | SPL Token program. |
| `system_program` | `Program<System>` | System program. |

#### Arguments
_None_

#### Validations
- `config.status == Active` or `EmergencyPaused`
- `round.status == Ended`
- `bet.user == bettor.key()`
- `bet.status == Won`
- `bet.claimed == false`
- `round_vault` matches `round.vault`

#### Logic
1. Calculate reward amount based on:

$$
\text{reward} = \frac{\text{bet weight}}{\text{round winners weight}} \times \text{round total reward pool}
$$

3. Transfer reward `amount` of GRT from `round_vault` to `bettor_token_account`
4. Update `bet` fields:
    - Set `bet.claimed = true`

#### Emits / Side Effects
- Reward transferred from the round vault to the user's wallet
- Bet is marked as claimed

#### Errors
| Code                        | Meaning                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Unauthorized` | If `bet.user != bettor.key()` |
| `RoundNotEnded` | If `round.status != Ended` |
| `BetNotWon` | If `bet.status != Won` |
| `AlreadyClaimed` | If `bet.claimed == true` |

## PDA Seeds Strategy

This program uses Program Derived Addresses (PDA) to create deterministic and predictable accounts. Here's the seed strategy used:

### Config Account
- **Seeds**: `["config"]`
- **Purpose**: Stores global program configuration such as admin, treasury, fee settings, and program status
- **Unique**: Yes, only one config account per program
- **Example**: Program ID + ["config"] â†’ Config PDA

### Round Account  
- **Seeds**: `["round", round_id]`
- **Purpose**: Stores round betting information such as asset, start/end time, status, total pool, etc.
- **Unique**: No, one account can multiple-bet per round_id
- **Parameters**:
  - `round_id`: u64 converted to bytes (little-endian)
- **Example**: Program ID + ["round", 1u64.to_le_bytes()] â†’ Round PDA for round 1

### Vault Account
- **Seeds**: `["vault", round]`  
- **Purpose**: Token account that stores all GRT tokens from bets in a single round
- **Unique**: Yes, one vault per round
- **Parameters**:
  - `round`: Public key of the round account (32 bytes)
- **Example**: Program ID + ["vault", round.key().to_bytes().as_ref()] â†’ Vault PDA for round 1

### Bet Account
- **Seeds**: `["bet", round, bet_index]`
- **Purpose**: Stores individual user bet information for a specific round
- **Unique**: Yes, one bet per user per round
- **Parameters**:
  - `round`: Public key of the round account (32 bytes)
  - `bet_index`: u64 converted to bytes (little-endian) to allow multiple bets per user per round
- **Example**: Program ID + ["bet", round.key().to_bytes().as_ref(), &bet_index.to_le_bytes()] â†’ Bet PDA for user in round 1

### Rust Implementation

```rust
// Config PDA
let (config_pda, config_bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(
    &[b"config"],
    program_id
);
// Round PDA
let (round_pda, round_bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(
    &[b"round", &round_id.to_le_bytes()],
    program_id
);

// Vault PDA
let (vault_pda, vault_bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(
    &[b"vault", round.key().to_bytes().as_ref()],
    program_id
);

// Bet PDA
let (bet_pda, bet_bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(
    &[b"bet", round.key().as_ref(), &bet_index.to_le_bytes()],
    program_id
);
```
