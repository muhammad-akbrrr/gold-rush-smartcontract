# Gold Rush Smart Contract

Gold Rush is a token-based betting smart contract that allows users to bet on the price movement of gold or specific stocks within a specific time period (called a round).

Users place bets using Gold Rush Tokens (GRT), and winners receive rewards based on the outcome of the round.

## Overview
- Each round has a start time (start_time) and a end time (end_time), during which users can place or withdraw bets before the cutoff.
- After the round ends, the Keeper triggers a settlement process to determine the winner based on the price from the Oracle.
- Rewards are not automatically distributed but are stored as a claimable amount that winners can claim manually.

## Features

### Betting System

- Users can place bets on the price movement of gold or specific stocks (e.g., up/down).
- Bets are placed using GRT tokens.
- Bets can be withdrawn as long as they have not exceeded the cutoff.

### Round Lifecycle

- Admins create new rounds with a start_time and end_time.
- After the start_time, the round automatically becomes Active and accepts bets.
- After the end_time, bets are locked and the round enters the Settlement process and the outcome is determined.

### Keeper Automation

- The Keeper is responsible for triggering:
    - Round activation when the start_time is reached.
    - Round settlement when the end_time is reacged.
- The Keeper retrieves prices from the Oracle, calculates winners, and marks claimable prizes.
- If the price is not retrieved, the round is assigned a PendingSettlement status so it can be retried.

### Price Oracle

- Retrieves real-time prices from an external source (Chainlink or other whitelisted sources).
- Price data is only used during settlement process.

### Rewards & Claims

- Rewards are calculated from the total pool of losing bets and distributed proportionally to winners.
- Rewards are not sent automatically but are stored in the bet as claimable_amount.
- Users can claim rewards after settlement, if claimable_amount > 0.

### Admin Operations

- Create a new round (with a future schedule).
- Manage system configurations (fees, oracle, etc.).
- Pause/unpause the program in an emergency.
- Cancel a round (before settlement) to return all bets.

### Emergency & Safety

- Admins can perform an emergency pause to temporarily stop all betting operations (except claims).
- If settlement fails, the round will be marked as Pending Settlement so that no additional bets are accepted and can be reprocessed.

## Fee Mechanism

The Gold Rush smart contract charges a fee on each bet to sustain the platform. The fee is collected in the same token used for betting (GRT) and is transferred to the treasury after the round is settled.

### Fee Structure

- **Gold Price Bets**: `fee_gold_price_bps` (in basis points, e.g., 50 bps = 0.5%)
- **Stock Price Bets**: `fee_stock_price_bps` (in basis points, e.g., 50 bps = 0.5%)
- **Treasury Account**: `treasury` (the account that receives collected fees)

> Note: Fee is calculated on the bet amount and deducted only at settlement, not at the time of placing a bet. This allows for refunds in case the round is cancelled.

### Fee Calculation

For each round, the total fee collected is calculated as:

$$
\text{fee} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{amount}_i \times \frac{\text{fee\_bps}}{10000}
$$

Where:

- $n$ = total number of bets in the round  
- $\text{amount}_i$ = bet amount of the $i$-th bet  
- $\text{fee\_bps}$ = fee basis points depending on bet type (gold or stock)

The remaining balance after fee deduction becomes the **reward pool**:

$$
\text{total\_reward\_pool} = \text{total\_pool} - \text{total\_fee\_collected}
$$

- `total_pool` = sum of all bet amounts in the round  
- `total_fee_collected` = sum of all fees deducted  
- `total_reward_pool` = amount available for distribution to winning bets

### Settlement Flow for Fees

1. **Round ends**: Keeper triggers the settlement process after `end_time`.  
2. **Calculate fees**: Fee is calculated for each bet based on `fee_gold_price_bps` or `fee_stock_price_bps`.  
3. **Transfer to treasury**: `total_fee_collected` is transferred to the treasury account.  
4. **Compute reward pool**: Remaining GRT is assigned to `total_reward_pool` for winners.  

> This approach ensures fairness and transparency: users only pay fees if the round is successfully settled, and the treasury receives an accurate portion without affecting refund logic.

### Example

Suppose a round has the following bets:

| User | Bet Amount | Bet Type   | Fee (bps) |
|------|------------|------------|------------|
| A    | 10 GRT     | Gold       | 50         |
| B    | 20 GRT     | Stock      | 100        |

Calculations:

- Fee for A: \( 10 \times 0.005 = 0.05 \) GRT  
- Fee for B: \( 20 \times 0.01 = 0.2 \) GRT  

Total fee collected: \( 0.05 + 0.2 = 0.25 \) GRT  

Total reward pool: \( 10 + 20 - 0.25 = 29.75 \) GRT

---

## Reward Calculation

This section explains the reward calculation logic used in the Gold Rush betting system.  
The system uses a **weight-based model** combined with a **self-claim mechanism** to optimize on-chain operations, especially when there are thousands of bets per round.

### Concept

Each bet has a **weight** that represents its contribution to the total reward pool.  
The weight is influenced by:

1. **Bet Amount**: Larger bets contribute more.
2. **Bet Type Factor**: Bets on `PercentageChange` may carry a higher factor than simple `Up/Down` bets.
3. **Time Factor**: Bets placed earlier in the round may carry a higher weight than bets placed near the end of the round.

The general formula for a bet's weight:

$$
\text{weight} = \text{amount} \times \text{side\_factor} \times \text{time\_factor}
$$

Where:

- `amount` = number of GRT tokens bet
- `side_factor` = multiplier based on `BetSide`
  - Up/Down: `1.0`
  - PercentageChange: `>1.0` depending on the magnitude of percentage
- `time_factor` = multiplier based on how early the bet was placed (range: $0 < \text{time\_factor} \le 1.0$)

---

### Settlement

During settlement:

1. The **Keeper** determines the winning bets by comparing `locked_price` and `final_price`.
2. For all winning bets:
   - Mark `Bet.status = Won`
   - Sum their weights into `round.winners_weight`:

$$
\text{round.winners\_weight} = \sum_{\text{all winning bets}} \text{bet.weight}
$$

3. For losing bets:
   - Mark `Bet.status = Lost`
   - Weight is ignored for reward calculation.

> **Note:** No reward amount is calculated yet. Only weights are updated. This avoids looping all bets during settlement, optimizing on-chain efficiency.

---

### Self-Claim by User

When a user claims their reward:

1. Read `Bet.weight` and `round.winners_weight`.
2. Calculate the claimable reward:

$$
\text{reward} = \frac{\text{bet.weight}}{\text{round.winners\_weight}} \times \text{round.total\_pool}
$$

3. Transfer the reward from the round vault to the user's account.
4. Mark `Bet.claimed = true`.

> This approach ensures:
> - **No heavy loops** during settlement
> - Reward is calculated **on-demand**
> - Users can **preview rewards** before claiming if needed (optional off-chain)

---

### Example Calculation

| User | Amount (GRT) | Bet Type | Time Factor | Weight |
|------|--------------|----------|------------|--------|
| A    | 10           | Up       | 1.0        | 10     |
| B    | 10           | Percentage | 1.2      | 12     |

- Total weight of winners: \( 10 + 12 = 22 \)  
- Total pool: 20 GRT  

$$
\text{Reward A} = \frac{10}{22} \times 20 \approx 9.09\text{ GRT}
$$
$$
\text{Reward B} = \frac{12}{22} \times 20 \approx 10.91\text{ GRT}
$$

---

### Summary

- Settlement **only sets status** (Won/Lost) and updates `winners_weight`.
- Reward calculation is deferred to **self-claim**, ensuring efficiency.
- Weight incorporates **amount**, **bet type**, and **time factor**.
- The model is flexible and can be adjusted for new bet types or reward rules.
